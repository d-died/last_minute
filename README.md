# My Last Minute App 
## Derek Sumpmann, Mar 2022
====================================
## Description

wilt is (going to be) a subreddit-style forum where users can read and submit posts from other users around the world. Users submit any and everything they learned that day along with some general demographic info. The posts are listed to be read and upvoted, and the other data collected is presented visually within an app component.

## Tech eventually used:
1. ReactJS
2. MySQL
3. Express / NodeJS
4. D3 / Chart.js
(Tech actually used: REACT, Mongo, Mongoose)

## User Stories (of ideas past):
- As a user, I can create an account with login credentials. 
- As a user, I can read other people's posts. 
- As a user, I can see some visuals (graphs, etc.) based on data from the posts. 
- As a user with credentials, I can create a post including a description, my age, and my location. 
- As a user with credentials, I can up/down vote other people's posts. 
- As a user with credentials, I can view, create, update, and delete my own posts. 


## Strech Goal User Stories (to be continued):
- As a user, I can view all posts sorted in different ways.
- As a user, I can comment on other people's posts. 
- As a user, I can respond to people's posts with different reactions.
